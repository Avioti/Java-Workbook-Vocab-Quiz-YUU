When comparing objects like Strings, the Equality Operator (==) compares what?|The content (text) of the objects.|References (memory locations) of the objects.|The data types.|The length of the objects.|References (memory locations) of the objects.
Which principle is best demonstrated by a public Interface that exposes a small set of methods while concealing the complex business logic of its implementing private class?|Cohesion|Inheritance|Polymorphism|Abstraction|Abstraction
In Java, which feature enables a single class or method to operate on objects of various types while maintaining compile-time type safety?|Method Overloading|Generics|Type Casting|Method Overriding|Generics
Which pair of concepts describes the trade-off between how focused a class is on a single responsibility versus how dependent it is on other classes?|Abstract/Concrete|Public/Private|Cohesion/Coupling|Subclass/Superclass|Cohesion/Coupling
The primary design goal of using Encapsulation (private fields + public getters/setters) is to prevent what?|Recursive calls.|Memory leaks.|Direct data corruption.|Compilation errors.|Direct data corruption.
A static field in a Java class is loaded into memory when the class is loaded, making its state:|Thread-local and unique.|Shared across all instances and threads.|Immutable at runtime.|Accessible only via reflection.|Shared across all instances and threads.
What is the fundamental difference between a Checked Exception (like IOException) and an Unchecked Exception (like NullPointerException)?|Checked exceptions can be caught, unchecked cannot.|Checked exceptions must be declared or caught, unchecked are optional.|Checked exceptions occur at runtime, unchecked at compile time.|Unchecked exceptions relate to I/O, checked relate to logic.|Checked exceptions must be declared or caught, unchecked are optional.
Why is the @Override annotation considered a best practice when a subclass redefines a parent's method?|It makes the method run faster.|It automatically handles type casting.|It prevents a logic error if the method signature is misspelled.|It enforces private visibility.|It prevents a logic error if the method signature is misspelled.
A program successfully compiles but crashes when it tries to access an element at an index that doesn't exist. This is a classic example of a:|Syntax Error|Logical Design Error|Compile-Time Error|Runtime Exception (Error)|Runtime Exception (Error)
Which version control action should be used to securely integrate changes from a feature branch back into the main branch, creating a new commit?|Push|Fetch|Rebase|Merge|Merge
What is the primary technical advantage of using the StringBuilder class over repeated string concatenation (+) in a loop?|It allows for lazy loading of resources.|It is a mutable object, preventing the creation of new objects.|It automatically handles thread synchronization.|It provides immediate casting capabilities.|It is a mutable object, preventing the creation of new objects.
Which of the following scenarios best demonstrates Method Overloading?|A subclass providing an implementation for an abstract method.|Two methods in the same class having the same name but different return types.|Two methods in the same class having the same name but different parameter lists.|A method that is declared as final and cannot be changed.|Two methods in the same class having the same name but different parameter lists.
The primary purpose of the Manifest File within a JAR archive is to tell the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) what?|Which external libraries are required.|The location of the main execution class.|The maximum memory allocation (heap size).|The version of the Java compiler used.|The location of the main execution class.
In the context of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), what is the immediate purpose of Bytecode?|To be executed directly by the CPU.|To serve as an intermediate, platform-independent instruction set.|To replace the operating system's kernel.|To compile the source code into a native executable.|To serve as an intermediate, platform-independent instruction set.
What is the most significant constraint imposed by the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in software architecture?|Preventing the use of comments in code.|Minimizing the number of class files in a project.|Ensuring every piece of knowledge has a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation.|Restricting the use of public visibility.|Ensuring every piece of knowledge has a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation.
What type of memory is used for the execution stack, local variables, and method call frames?|Heap Memory|Persistent Storage|Volatile Memory|Stack Memory|Stack Memory
Which I/O class, if not closed properly after use, can lead to a resource leak and potentially file system corruption?|String|System|Scanner|Math|Scanner
What does the term Polymorphism fundamentally allow in an object-oriented design?|Allowing multiple classes to have identical names.|Allowing an object to take on many forms via a superclass or interface reference.|Allowing a child class to inherit fields but not methods.|Allowing method calls to be resolved at compile time only.|Allowing an object to take on many forms via a superclass or interface reference.
Why are Field/Property variables typically declared as private in a well-designed class?|To allow direct modification from any external class.|To maximize performance by minimizing overhead.|To enable Encapsulation and control modification via Setter methods.|To prevent them from being inherited by subclasses.|To enable Encapsulation and control modification via Setter methods.
